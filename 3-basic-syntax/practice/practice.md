# Practice Markdown

## Paragraphs

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it from now on.

Line break
----------

This is the first line.  
This is the second line.

## Emphasis

I love **bold** text.
I rarely use *italic* text.
Practice is ***important***.

## Blockquotes

- This is the first blockquote:

> Dorothy followed her through many rooms.

- This is the second blockquote:

> This is the first paragraph.
>
> This is the second paragraph.

- This is the third blockquote:

> ### The quarterly results look great!
> 
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
> *Everything is going well.*
