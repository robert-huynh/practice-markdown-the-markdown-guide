### Lightweight Markup Languages

There are several lightweight markup languages that are *supersets* of Markdown. They include Gruber's basic syntax and build upon it by adding additional elements like tables, code blocks, syntax highlighting, URL auto-linking, and footnotes. Many of the most popular Markdown applications use one of the following light weight markup languages:

- [CommonMark] (http://commonmark.org)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)] (https://github.github.com/gtm/)
- [Markdown Extra] (https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)
- [MultiMarkdown] (http://fletcherpenny.net/multimarkdown/)
